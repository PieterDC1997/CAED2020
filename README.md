# CAED2020


First of all, I will send the BDF raw data files to you personally, because the files are too large to upload on Github.

Second, the user should change the name of the directory, line 39 in the main script, and line 25 in the single subject script, 
to own preferences.

Third, the user should create directories in this directory:
•	A directory called ‘Subjects’, were the user stores the raw BDF files.
•	An empty ‘EEG_Process’
•	An empty ‘EEG_Evoked’
•	An empty ‘EEG_Source’

If the user completes these steps and installs the required Anaconda-packages, then the scripts should run without any problems. 
I have tested this on another computer. 

The single subject script just adds some more visualization, for a single subject. But the idea behind is basically the same as the main
script, so if you'd like, you can skip this script and fully focus on the main script.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Cheers,
Pieter
